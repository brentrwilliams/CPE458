ToDo:
- Deal with vigenere cipher mess-ups
   - Do analysis to see if any of the caesar cipher get_best_key has keys that are within a standard of deviation of the best key you found
   - Include those as the return value 
   - Try all combos of the return values with ngram analysis and return the best one
